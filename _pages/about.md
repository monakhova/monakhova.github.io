We combine ideas from machine learning, signal processing, optics, computer vision and physics to build better imaging systems (cameras, microscopes, and telescopes) through the <span class="font-weight-bold">co-design of optics, algorithms, and high-level tasks</span>. Our aim is to design the next generation of smart, computational imagers that fuel scientific discovery, robotics, and medical diagnostics. We are particularly interested in:

<ul>
<li> <span class="font-weight-bold">Differentiable optics</span> - Can we use data and machine learning tools to design better cameras, microscopes, and telescopes?</li>
<li> <span class="font-weight-bold">Physics-informed machine learning</span> - How can we effectively combine our knowledge of imaging system physics with deep learning? </li>
<li> <span class="font-weight-bold">Task-based imaging systems</span> - What's the best camera or microscope for high-level tasks, such as robotics or medical diagnostics?</li>
<li> <span class="font-weight-bold">Inverse problems and neural representations</span>: Can we leverage neural priors to improve our imaging systems for microscopy and photography? </li>
<li> <span class="font-weight-bold">Uncertainty quantification in imaging</span>: How can we make imaging algorithms more trustworthy and robust for critical applications in science and medicine? </li>
</ul>
